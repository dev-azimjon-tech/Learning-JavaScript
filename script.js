// There are 3 types of variables :
//  var(old style),
//  let(new,modern and recomended), 
//  const(constant value can not be changed)


// Variables lesson:
// let name = "Azimjon";
// let age = 16;
// const country = "Tajikistan";

// console.log("Your name is " + name + " you are " + age +" years old. And you are from " + country);

// Tasks for variables
// Task 1:
// Create a variable for your school name and another for your city. Then imagine printing them together.

// const school_name = "MTMU N5";
// const city_name = "Gulakandoz";

// console.log("My schools name is " + school_name + " and my city called " + city_name)

// Task 2
// Create a variable to store your favorite sport. Later, change it to a different sport.

// let sport = "Football";
// sport = "Basketball";

// console.log("My favorite sport is " + sport)


// Task 3
// Think of two things you love doing. Create two variables for them, then create one more variable that combines both (like a sentence).

// let sport = "Basketball";
// let hobby = "Programming";
// let sentence = sport + " and " + hobby;

// console.log("I love " + sentence);

// Task 4
// Create two variables with different values. Then imagine you want to swap them — the first should now have the second’s value and vice versa.(Think how you’d do that using a third variable).

// let a = 2;
// let b = 10;
// let c = a = b;
// let d = b = a;

// console.log("The switched  value  of  a: " + c + " The switched value of b: " + d);


// Task 5

// const name = "Azimjon";
// let age = 16;
// let favorite_subject = "English";
// let future_job = "Programmer";

// console.log("Hi, I'm " + name + " I'm " + age + " years old. My favorite subject is " + favorite_subject + " And my future job is " + future_job);
